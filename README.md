YatzyBot 0.84 (07-03-2014)
==========================

A bot for playing the popular European Yatzy dice game in IRC (uses Java, PircBotX) with one or more players. Supports the following:

* Multi-server, multi-channel support (BETA) (0.83+).
* Rolling all dies.
* Rolling particular dies (just specify numbers on the dies, e.g., 5 6 1 1).
* Holding particular dies (again, just specify the numbers, not the die indices).
* Holding all of particular dies (e.g., 2 3 will match all of the 2 dies and all of the 3 dies).
* Full score tracking, will choose the best dies to use automatically for the chosen scoring.
* Viewing of all possible scoring, including scores.
* Output after each roll shows which are good scorings, great scorings, and no scorings.
* Games cannot be terminated by those not playing the game.

Limitations at the moment include:

* Cannot tell bot to join particular servers or channels from IRC if you are the owner of the bot â€” there are no commands to achieve this yet. Support will be coming soon! (~0.86+)
* If everyone in a game quits, the bot does not realise yet and terminate the game - better to wait some minutes just to make sure they are really gone! (~0.87+)
* Can't specify particular scorings with 'hardcoded dice' to hold, such as Small Straight or Large Straight (this would look like `.hold SS` to hold precisely the dice numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, ignoring the rest). (~0.88+)

Usage:

`java -jar yatzybot.jar [one or more of {nick@}[server] [channel1,channel2]]`. If running on a shell via SSH, it is recommended you use `nohup` to prevent SSH hangup from terminating the bot. Default nick is 'YatzyBot'.

Example command line: `java -jar yatzybot.jar irc.yourserver.net #yatzy,#chatland pimppi@irc.myserver.fi #hissi,#kissa`.
